There isn't much in this update.

- Added "Better Title Screen" to the client.
- Began work on making custom Minecolony buildings, attempting to be cheaper and simpler to build whilst also being more compact for efficient town building!
- Added a button to the main menu that brings you here, hello to all who came from the main menu!

Till' next time!
